A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across\
the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization,\
the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective\
defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate integrations across\
select Cisco Security products and accelerate key security operations functions detection,\
investigation, and remediation. Users must understand and comply with basic data security\
principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing\
up data. Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles. In todayâ€™s connected world, \
everyone benefits from advanced cyberdefense programs. At an individual level, \
a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts,\
to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure\
like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. \
Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.\
Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of  threat\
researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyber attack strategies. \
They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity,\
and strengthen open source tools. Their work makes the Internet safer for everyone.
